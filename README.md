**Better Color Profile** is the modern, lightweight display calibration and color profile manager that Windows always needed. 

Built for **Windows 11 and Windows 10**, it completely replaces the clunky, buried Windows Color Management applet (`colorcpl.exe`) with a sleek interface, global hotkeys, and real-time display tuning — allowing you to effortlessly create, customize, and cycle through color profiles with zero lag.

## 📦 Installation & Download

Compatible with **Windows 11 and Windows 10** (64-bit and 32-bit):

1. Download [**BetterColorProfileSetup.exe**](https://github.com/KOUKOU221/Better-Color-Profile/releases/latest/download/BetterColorProfileSetup.exe) (Direct download — automatically gets the latest release).
2. Run the setup wizard:
   - Modern installation wizard with custom destination directory selection (automatically creates and installs into a dedicated `BetterColorProfile` folder).
   - Optional Start with Windows and desktop/start-menu shortcuts (enabled by default).
   - Clean uninstallation support via Windows Settings / Installed Apps.

## 🛡️ 100% Anti-Cheat Friendly & Gamer Safe

Unlike shader injectors (such as ReShade) or custom overlays that hook into game processes, **Better Color Profile is 100% safe for all competitive online games**:

* **Zero Game Injection**: It never touches, hooks, or inspects game memory, DirectX, Vulkan, or OpenGL pipelines.
* **Official Windows APIs Only**: It interacts exclusively with official Microsoft Windows Color Management (`mscms.dll` / `WcsSetDefaultColorProfile`) and hardware display drivers (`gdi32!SetDeviceGammaRamp`).
* **Approved by Modern Anti-Cheats**: Kernel-level anti-cheat software (including **Riot Vanguard, Easy Anti-Cheat, BattlEye, Ricochet, and VAC**) recognize it as standard Windows display settings.
* **Zero Input Lag & Zero FPS Drop**: Because adjustments are applied at the GPU/monitor hardware LUT level, there is no performance penalty.

## 🎮 Why It's a Game-Changer for Gamers & Creators

* **Spot Enemies in Dark Corners**: Boost shadow visibility and contrast in competitive shooters (*CS2, Valorant, Apex Legends, Warzone, Escape from Tarkov*) without washing out bright areas.
* **Custom Digital Vibrance & Color Temperature**: Give your display punchy colors, vibrant highlights, or a warm eye-friendly night tint per game.
* **Customizable Hotkey Switching**: Switch instantly between your high-visibility gaming profile and accurate sRGB desktop profile without Alt-Tabbing or closing your game. Bind any key or combination you prefer.
* **Color Accuracy for Creators**: Switch back to true, calibrated sRGB for Photoshop, Premiere, or web browsing in a single click.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. ⚡ Instant Profile Application & Sidebar Slots
* **One-Click Apply**: Preview profiles in your sidebar without interrupting your display until you click the prominent **Apply** button.
* **Slot Management**: Organize your favorite profiles into custom slots (Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3...).
* **Protected Default Profile**: Your default Windows sRGB color profile is protected in a hidden internal directory (`.internal\`) — impossible to delete or corrupt accidentally.
* **Ghost Profile Cleanup**: Automatically synchronizes with installed Windows profiles and unregisters orphaned or deleted display associations from Windows Color Management.

### 2. 🎛️ 7-Slider Real-Time Display Tuner
* **Fine-Grained Hardware Calibration**:
  - Master Brightness (-100% to +100%)
  - Master Contrast (-100% to +100%)
  - Color Temperature (Warm to Cool)
  - Color Balance: Red, Green, and Blue fine-tuning
  - Gamma Curve adjustment
* **Automatic Sequential Naming**: Creating a new profile? If no name is provided, names are automatically pre-filled sequentially (`Profile 1`, `Profile 2`, etc.).
* **Instant ICC Generation**: Saves calibrated profiles directly into the `list\` directory and auto-associates them with your primary monitor.

### 3. ⌨️ Global & Per-Slot Hotkeys
* **Direct Per-Slot Shortcuts**: Assign an individual shortcut to any profile slot (e.g. `Ctrl + 1`, `F1`, or any custom key combination) to jump directly to that profile without cycling.
* **Cycle Shortcut**: Press your cycle shortcut anywhere to sequentially cycle through all configured profile slots:
  $$\text{Slot 1} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{Slot 2} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{Slot 3} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{...} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{Slot 1}$$
* Fully customizable hotkey bindings in the Profiles tab (supports single keys and custom combinations with zero latency).

### 4. 🧰 System Tray & Background Daemon
* Minimizing or closing the window sends it directly to the system tray so the hotkey remains active.
* Right-click tray menu provides quick slot switching, status overview, and settings.
* Enable **Start with Windows** to keep your preferred profiles ready on startup.
